    "text": "üìà Temporal Trends in the Top 5 Most Dangerous Countries\nBeyond geography, risk also shows clear temporal variation. To explore this, we selected the five countries with the highest total number of incidents and analyzed how the number of attacks has evolved over time.\nThe line chart reveals distinct trajectories of risk in each country. Some countries experienced sharp spikes in violence during specific years, while others maintained long-term high-risk environments. These trends suggest that the threats aid workers face are closely tied to the intensity and stage of local armed conflicts. A decline in conflict, or ‚Äúcooling off,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean peace‚Äîit often simply changes the form and focus of violence.\n\n\nShow code\n# Select the top 5 countries with the most events\ntop5_countries = df['Country'].value_counts().head(5).index.tolist()\ndf_top5 = df[df['Country'].isin(top5_countries)]\n\n# Incidents per country per year\ngrouped = df_top5.groupby(['Year', 'Country']).size().reset_index(name='Event Count')\n\n# Line chart\nfig = px.line(grouped, \n              x='Year', y='Event Count', color='Country', \n              markers=True,\n              title='Event Trend Over Time for Top 5 Countries')\n\nfig.update_layout(height=500)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe following two examples can well reflect that the trends shown in the line chart are closely related to conflicts in real life:\n\nüü• Afghanistan: Long-Term High Risk, Declining After 2014\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the United States launched its war on terror, ousting the Taliban and supporting the formation of a new government. Afghanistan remained in a prolonged state of war and insurgency. From 2009 to 2013, as Taliban activity intensified and NATO‚Äôs military presence expanded, attacks on NGOs, international organizations, and aid workers increased dramatically.\n\n\n\nAfghan civilians carrying supplies\n\n\nSource: OCHA\nFollowing NATO‚Äôs official end to combat operations in 2014, the number of recorded incidents began to noticeably decline. This trend reflects both a shift in the nature of the conflict and a reduction in international aid operations on the ground.\n\n\nüü£ Syria: Humanitarian Breakdown Amid Civil War\nIn 2011, the Arab Spring reached Syria, and what began as protest movements quickly escalated into a nationwide armed conflict. With the Assad regime, opposition forces, and militant groups like ISIS all fighting for control, Syria became one of the most complex humanitarian crises in the world.\n\n\n\nSyrian people queuing for food\n\n\nSource: The Washington Post\nDuring the peak years of ISIS activity (2013‚Äì2017), aid workers faced kidnappings, targeted violence, and mass atrocities. Aid convoys, hospitals, and humanitarian facilities were frequently attacked or blockaded. Even today, northwest Syria remains largely inaccessible to international organizations due to ongoing insecurity and political barriers."

However, just two years later, in late 2013, a violent power struggle erupted between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar, sparking a brutal civil war and deepening ethnic divisions.\n\n\n\nSouth Sudanese volunteers carrying relief supplies\n\n\nSource: Top Africa News\nThe threats facing aid workers in South Sudan are rooted in the country‚Äôs political fragility and fractured security environment:\n\nNumerous non-state armed groups operate beyond government control, and the state lacks authority over large rural areas and transport routes;\nHumanitarian goods are often seen as ‚Äúresources of war,‚Äù and aid workers are frequently targeted for looting, leverage, or political coercion;\nIn some regions, a ‚Äúpost-attack aid cycle‚Äù emerges‚Äîarmed groups ambush aid missions and then lie in wait for future relief deliveries;\nInfrastructure is extremely weak, with poor roads and limited communication, making emergency response vulnerable to isolation.\n\nDespite international efforts to support peace, conflict remains sporadic, and local staff‚Äîwho make up the majority of humanitarian personnel‚Äîbear a disproportionate share of the violence and emotional toll. Humanitarian work in South Sudan today faces the dual challenge of high risk and low visibility.\n\n\nüü§ Sudan: A Country in Transition‚Äîand in Turmoil\nFollowing the ousting of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019, Sudan appeared poised for democratic transition. Yet, the fragile power-sharing agreement between civilian and military actors quickly unraveled, culminating in a devastating civil conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in 2023.\n\n\n\nInternational aid workers walking side by side\n\n\nSource: European Commission\nFor aid workers, Sudan now represents a multi-layered risk environment:\n\nMajor cities‚Äîincluding the capital, Khartoum‚Äîhave become battle zones, meaning even historically ‚Äúsafe‚Äù urban areas are under fire;\nMass displacement has surged across borders, but many crossings are under contested control;\nHumanitarian warehouses and offices have been looted, and some repurposed as barracks or weapons storage;\nBoth SAF and RSF have been reported to obstruct humanitarian access and intimidate aid personnel.\n\nThe danger in Sudan lies not only in the scale of conflict, but in its complexity: a fractured society, foreign interference, and growing skepticism about the neutrality of humanitarian organizations. Many international NGOs have been forced to withdraw or operate remotely, leaving only limited in-country capacity to respond.\n\n\nüü¢ Occupied Palestinian Territories: Humanitarian Work Under Siege\nThe Occupied Palestinian Territories‚Äîespecially the Gaza Strip‚Äîexist under conditions of intense military pressure, frequent armed clashes, and severe humanitarian need. Recurring conflict between Israeli forces and Hamas has turned humanitarian aid into a highly politicized and operationally constrained effort.\n\n\n\nAid workers standing in front of medical supplies\n\n\nSource: MAP\nAid workers in the region face a unique set of challenges:\n\nAerial bombardment is the most significant threat, and workers often lack adequate shelter or early-warning systems;\nAid convoys and medical facilities have been repeatedly struck‚Äîwhether by accident or not ‚Äî with even ambulances and hospitals at risk;\nGround incursions in areas like Gaza City and refugee camps result in intense urban combat, with no guaranteed humanitarian corridors;\nTight border and movement restrictions severely limit deployment, rotation, or evacuation of international staff.\n\nWhile organizations like the UN maintain long-term operations in Gaza and the West Bank, the physical overlap between aid missions and military targets creates constant danger. Humanitarian actors also face pressure on their credibility, neutrality, and legal standing in such a contested space."

    "text": "This project set out to explore how data visualization can help us better understand and communicate the risks faced by humanitarian aid workers across the globe. Through a combination of interactive charts and narrative storytelling, we uncovered critical spatial and temporal patterns:\nConflict hotspots shift over time: While countries like Afghanistan have historically dominated incident counts, recent years have seen rising violence in regions such as South Sudan, Sudan, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nLocal aid workers are disproportionately affected: Year-over-year trends show that national staff consistently suffer the highest rates of injury, death, and kidnapping, often due to proximity to high-risk environments and limited protective resources.\nViolence against aid workers is context-specific: The nature of attacks‚Äîwhether targeted ambushes, crossfire, or aerial bombardments‚Äîvaries significantly by country and conflict dynamics, necessitating tailored risk mitigation strategies.\nThese patterns remind us that humanitarian work does not occur in a vacuum. Instead, it is deeply entangled in the political, military, and social fabrics of the regions aid organizations seek to support.\n\n\n\nBased on our focused analysis of the most dangerous countries in recent years, we offer the following evidence-based suggestions:\n\n\nKey finding: Over 80% of attacks in South Sudan were either bodily assaults or shootings, and ambushes accounted for nearly 44% of the attack contexts. Roads and project sites were the most common attack locations.\n‚úÖ Recommendations:\n\nTravel in convoys and avoid dispatching staff in small groups, as ambushes often target isolated vehicles or lightly staffed teams.\nInvest in project site security and early warning systems, since field operations are a significant source of exposure.\nTrain national and international staff for high-intensity attack scenarios, particularly violent assault and armed raids, which are statistically the most common threats in this region.\n\n\n\n\nKey finding: In Sudan, shootings, shelling, and crossfire were the primary causes of harm to aid workers. Around 41% of incidents occurred during ongoing combat, and nearly all major urban areas have become unsafe. Homes and roads each made up 26% of all attack locations.\n‚úÖ Recommendations:\n\nDecentralize housing and office locations, as fixed, concentrated staff sites‚Äîespecially in urban centers‚Äîare vulnerable to indiscriminate shelling or occupation by armed forces.\nDevelop partnerships with local communities and protection actors to receive real-time updates on territorial shifts and active combat zones.\nPrepare urban contingency plans (e.g., escape routes, alternative supply corridors) as aid workers are increasingly caught in street-level or neighborhood-based battles.\n\n\n\n\nKey finding: More than 54% of all recorded attacks on aid workers in the OPT were caused by aerial bombardment. Additionally, over 80% of incidents occurred in the context of crossfire or active combat, and project sites, homes, and public locations were all significant points of risk.\n‚úÖ Recommendations:\n\nPrioritize the negotiation of humanitarian corridors or ceasefire windows with relevant military and political actors. Since aerial strikes are the leading threat, predictable safety zones and timing are essential for operations.\nEnsure that all personnel, vehicles, and facilities are visibly marked with neutral humanitarian symbols (e.g., UN, ICRC), while also preparing for rapid evacuation in case of mass-casualty airstrikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond country-level specifics, the data suggests several cross-cutting best practices for the humanitarian sector:\nStrengthen local staff protection: Since national staff bear the brunt of the violence, organizations should invest more in their training, insurance, psychological support, and security.\nIntegrate real-time data analysis into field operations. Use incident tracking, risk scoring, and geospatial dashboards to dynamically adjust deployment decisions.\nPromote inter-agency coordination and information sharing, particularly in high-risk or fast-evolving environments.\nAdvocate for legal protections and accountability mechanisms, especially where violence against aid workers remains unpunished.\n\n\n\nThe data we‚Äôve examined tells more than a story of numbers‚Äîit speaks of sacrifice, resilience, and quiet courage. Behind every charted point lies a name, a mission, a person who chose to step into danger rather than walk away. These are individuals who carry hope on their shoulders, navigating gunfire, airstrikes, and lawlessness‚Äîall in service of humanity.\nBy shedding light on the risks that aid workers face, this project seeks not only to inform policy and practice, but also to honor their steadfast bravery. These visualizations are not merely analytical tools; they are a tribute to those who run toward suffering with compassion, who risk everything so that others may live.\nWe hope for a world where such risks are no longer necessary‚Äî a world where war and conflict give way to peace, and humanitarian aid becomes a bridge of hope, not a shield against harm.\nWe close with a call to action: Let this data not sit quietly in reports and dashboards. Let it guide your decisions. Let it shape protections. Let it save lives.\n\n\n\nPigeon\n\n\nSource: Vecteezy\n\n\n\n\nUN OCHA. Global Humanitarian Overview 2024. Link\n\nMSF.
