Humanitarian aid workers operate in some of the worldâ€™s most dangerous environmentsâ€”regions marked by conflict, instability, and humanitarian crisis.

This project offers a data-driven exploration of **attacks on aid workers** between **1997 and 2025**, aiming to uncover where, when, and how these threats occur.

By geographic and temporal visualizations, we focus on:

- Identifying the most dangerous countries for aid personnel  
- Understanding how risks vary by location, attack method, and time  
- Providing **evidence-based recommendations** for agencies and field teams  

Our goal is not only to inform â€” but to support safer humanitarian operations by transforming data into actionable insights.
